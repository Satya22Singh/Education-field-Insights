I have completed this project using the Power Bi tools.
The purpose of this project was to analyze the "All-Ages" dataset to uncover insights about education, employment, and salary trends across different fields of study .
This analysis helps understand career outcomes based on education majors.

key insights of this project:
Engineering majors have the highest salaries.

Arts majors have relatively higher unemployment rates.

Business majors have a good balance of salary and employment.
